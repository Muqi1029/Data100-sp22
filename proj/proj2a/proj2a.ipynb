    "## This Assignment\n",
    "You will use what you've learned in class to create a classifier that can distinguish spam (junk or commercial or bulk) emails from ham (non-spam) emails. In addition to providing some skeleton code to fill in, we will evaluate your work based on your model's accuracy and your written responses in this notebook.\n",

    "- Feature engineering with text data\n",
    "- Using `sklearn` libraries to process data and fit models\n",
    "- Validating the performance of your model and minimizing overfitting\n",
    "- Generating and analyzing precision-recall curves\n",
    "\n",
    "This first part of the project focuses on initial analysis. In the second part of this project (to be released next week),  you will build your own spam/ham classifier.\n",

    "This is a **real world** dataset – the emails you are trying to classify are actual spam and legitimate emails. As a result, some of the spam emails may be in poor taste or be considered inappropriate. We think the benefit of working with realistic data outweighs these innapropriate emails, and wanted to give a warning at the beginning of the homework so that you are made aware."

    "We would like to take the text of an email and predict whether the email is ham or spam. This is a *classification* problem, so we can use logistic regression to train a classifier. Recall that to train a logistic regression model we need a numeric feature matrix $X$ and a vector of corresponding binary labels $y$.  Unfortunately, our data are text, not numbers. To address this, we can create numeric features derived from the email text and use those features for logistic regression.\n",

Using the [`LogisticRegression`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html) classifier, train a logistic regression model using `X_train` and `Y_train`. Then, output the model\\&#x27;s training accuracy below.

Accuracy on the training set doesn\\&#x27;t always translate to accuracy in the real world (on the test set). In future parts of this analysis, we will hold out some of our data for model validation and comparison.\\\\n&quot;,\\n    &quot;\\\\n&quot;,\\n    &quot;Presumably, our classifier will be used for **filtering**, i.e. preventing messages labeled `spam` from reaching someone\\&#x27;s inbox. There are two kinds of errors we can make:\\\\n&quot;,\\n    &quot;- False positive (FP): a ham email gets flagged as spam and filtered out of the inbox.\\\\n&quot;,\\n    &quot;- False negative (FN): a spam email gets mislabeled as ham and ends up in the inbox.\\\\n&quot;,\\n    &quot;\\\\n&quot;,\\n    &quot;To be clear, we label spam emails as 1 and ham emails as 0. These definitions depend both on the true labels and the predicted labels. False positives and false negatives may be of differing importance, leading us to consider more ways of evaluating a classifier, in addition to overall accuracy:\\\\n&quot;,\\n    &quot;\\\\n&quot;,\\n    &quot;**Precision** measures the proportion $\\\\\\\\frac{\\\\\\\\text{TP}}{\\\\\\\\text{TP} + \\\\\\\\text{FP}}$ of emails flagged as spam that are actually spam.\\\\n&quot;,\\n    &quot;\\\\n&quot;,\\n    &quot;**Recall** measures the proportion $\\\\\\\\frac{\\\\\\\\text{TP}}{\\\\\\\\text{TP} + \\\\\\\\text{FN}}$ of spam emails that were correctly flagged as spam. \\\\n&quot;,\\n    &quot;\\\\n&quot;,\\n    &quot;**False-alarm rate** measures the proportion $\\\\\\\\frac{\\\\\\\\text{FP}}{\\\\\\\\text{FP} + \\\\\\\\text{TN}}$ of ham emails that were incorrectly flagged as spam. \\\\n&quot;,\\n    &quot;\\\\n&quot;,\\n    &quot;The below graphic (modified slightly from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall)) may help you understand precision and recall visually:\\\\n&quot;,\\n    &quot;![precision_recall](images/precision_recall.png)\\\\n&quot;,\\n    &quot;\\\\n&quot;,\\n    &quot;Note that a true positive (TP) is a spam email that is classified as spam, and a true negative (TN) is a ham email that is classified as ham.&quot;\\n   ]\\n  },\\n  {\\n   &quot;cell_type&quot;: &quot;markdown&quot;,\\n   &quot;metadata&quot;: {\\n    &quot;deletable&quot;: false,\\n    &quot;editable&quot;: false,\\n    &quot;nbgrader&quot;: {\\n     &quot;grade&quot;: false,\\n     &quot;grade_id&quot;: &quot;q6&quot;,\\n     &quot;locked&quot;: true,\\n     &quot;schema_version&quot;: 2,\\n     &quot;solution&quot;: false\\n    }\\n   },\\n   &quot;source&quot;: [\\n    &quot;&lt;br/&gt;\\\\n&quot;,\\n    &quot;\\\\n&quot;,\\n    &quot;&lt;hr style=\\\\&quot;border: 1px solid #fdb515;\\\\&quot; /&gt;\\\\n&quot;,\\n    &quot;\\\\n&quot;,\\n    &quot;### Question 6\\\\n&quot;,\\n    &quot;\\\\n&quot;,\\n    &quot;### Question 6a\\\\n&quot;,\\n    &quot;\\\\n&quot;,\\n    &quot;Suppose we have a classifier `zero_predictor` that always predicts 0 (never predicts positive).
